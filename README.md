# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Coursera
This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course. The R script, run_analysis.R, does the following:

*Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
*Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
*Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
*Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
*From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
